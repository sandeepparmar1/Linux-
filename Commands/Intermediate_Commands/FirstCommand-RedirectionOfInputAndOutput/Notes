Before redirection of input and output we need to learn how input and output stream works in Linux
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				 ________________
------Command Line Argument---->|		 |
				|		 |
				|		 |-----------Standard Output
				|    Command	 |
------ Standard Input---------->|		 |-----------Standard Error
				|		 |
				------------------	

Commands can take input from two ways 
	1) Command Line Argument
	2) Standard Input

After input command create Output in two ways
	1) Standard Output
	2) Standard Error


Standard Input,Output and Error are Data Streams and streams can be manipulated this means they can be redirected or piped to another command

NOTE : Command line argument are static in nature and can't be redirected 

This 3 data streams are associated with some numbers 
1) Standard Input associate with 0
2) Standard Output associate with 1
3) Standard Error associates with 2

Some Important points before Redirection topic
--------------------------------------------------
1) By default standard input is connected with keyboard 
2) By default standard output and error is connected with terminal 

But Based on our requirement we can redirect this from standard devices 

REDIRECTION NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Standard input ,Standard output and Standard error are data streams hence they can flow from one place to another place.
we can redirect these streams

REDIRECTING STANDARD OUTPUT
----------------------------------
1) Standard output is associated with 1
2) Standard output connected with terminal by default , But we can redirect this standard output from terminal to some where 
else based on our requirement

3) We can perform output redirection by using > and >> symbols
	">" represent OverWritting
	">>" represent Appending


Example command for redirection standard output 
cat 1> <FileName>
cat 1>> <FileName>
	or 
cat FileName 1>> FileName2

1) here in first set of command we are using output redirection to redirect keyboard data in given file rather then terminal
2) in second set we are redirecting cat created FileName output data to FileName2 hence we are copying data from one file to another

NOTE: Bydefault > and >> are always meant for output redirection hence , using 1 with >> and > is optional


REDIRECTING STANDARD ERROR
------------------------------------

1) Bydefault standard error device is connected to terminal. we can use redirection to redirect error messages from terminal 
   to our required place


we can implement error redirection using "2>" or "2>>" symbols

Example
-----------
1) cat abc 2> error

In this command we are reading data from abc and if any error occur we are redirecting the error message to the error file 
Hence we are changing default terminal device to a file 

2) cat abc >> File1 2> error1

In this command we are reading data from abc file and redirecting data to file1 if any error come during this command redirect to the 
error1 file hence we can use multiple redirection 

REDIRECTING STANDARD INPUT
-----------------------------------
1) By default standard input device is connected with keyboard . But we can redirect from keyboard to somewhere else based on 
our requirement 

2) We can perform input redirection using this "<" symbol and the number associated with 0

Example
--------------
1) cat 0< fileName

Here in this command cat is taking input from a file <fileName> rather then keyboard and 
"<" is always associated with Standard input redirection hence using 0 is not mandatory 

Example
----------
1) cat 0< InputFile 1>> outputFile 2>> ErrorFile

Here cat is taking data from input file and output is redirect to outputfile if any error came it will we redirected to ErrorFile
