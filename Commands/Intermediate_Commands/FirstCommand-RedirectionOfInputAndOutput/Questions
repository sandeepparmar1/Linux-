Here are some good questions based on notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)   What are the three standard data streams in Linux, and what file descriptor numbers are associated with each?

2)   By default, where are the standard input, standard output, and standard error connected?

3)   How does the redirection operator ">" differ from ">>" when redirecting standard output?

4)   Explain what happens when you run the command `cat 1> FileName`. What is being redirected and why?

5)   How would you use the `cat` command to copy the contents of one file to another using redirection?

6)   What is the purpose of using `2>` in a command, and how does it work in the example `cat abc 2> error?

7)   How can you redirect both standard output and standard error simultaneously to separate files? Provide a command example.

8)   What does the command `cat 0< fileName` do, and why is the "0" optional in this context?

9)   In the command `cat 0< InputFile 1>> outputFile 2>> ErrorFile`, explain the role of each redirection operator 
     and the significance of each file descriptor.

10)  Why can't command line arguments be redirected like standard input, output, and error?
