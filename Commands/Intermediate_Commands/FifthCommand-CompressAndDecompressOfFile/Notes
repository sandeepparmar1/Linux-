Notes on compression and descompression of files
-------------------------------------------------------

In this we will we going to talk about common mechanism to compress and decompress files in Linux based system 
It's similar concept of windows zip and unzip file

In real world it's very common requirement to pack and unpack group of files 

It's a two step process
------------------------

1) Creation of archieve files
2) Apply compression algorithm 

1) Creation of archieve files : In this we put group of files in a container which further we pass to compression algorithms 
	
for creating archieve files we need to use tar command 
syntax
--------
	tar -cvf "tarFileName.tar" file1 file2 dir1 dir2

Here tar command use c option to create v for verbose and f for name file "tarFileName.tar" 
and we can pass file dir everything to this it will create the given name archieve file 

	tar -tvf "tarFileName" 	-> to view what content is present inside over archieve file
	
	tar -xvf "tarFileName"	-> to extract content of the archieve file


2) In second step we will apply compression algorithm to over tar archieve file

There are mutliple compression and decompression algorithms 
1) Using gzip
	gzip <ArchieveFile> 	-> this will compress file using gzip algorithm 

to unzip we can use 
	gzip -d <CompressedFile>
		or
	gunzip <CompressFile>

2) Using bzip2
	bzip2 <ArchieveFile>
To unzip we can use
	bzip2 -d <CompressFileName>
		or
	bunzip2 <CompressFileName>


Note: We should have knowledge which compression algorithm is used to uncompress the file 

We can achieve creation of Archieve file and compression in single command also 

1) tar -cvzf "FileName.tar.gz" file1 dir1 	-> it will create directly compresed file using gzip algorithm 

Note: using extension is important to understand which compression technique is used

2) tar -xvzf <FileName>		-> it will decompress and extract file data which is compressed by gzip

here z represent gzip 

Next is bzip2 

1) tar -cvjf <FileName.tar.bz2> file1 dir1 	-> It will archieve and compress files using bzip2 algorithm

2) tar -xvjf <fileName> 			-> to decompress and extract compressed file using bzip2
