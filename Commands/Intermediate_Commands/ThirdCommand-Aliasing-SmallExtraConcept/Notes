Notes on Aliasing and Using multiple independent commands in single line
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First let's talk about how we can use multple independent command in single line 

There is 2 ways of doing this 
-----------------------------

a) using ";"
b) using "&&"

syntax 
-----------

command - 1 ; command - 2 ; command - 3 ; command - 4;

-> Here all command will execute one by one 

2nd syntax
------------

command 1 && command 2 && command 3 && command 4

-> Here also all command will execute one by one 

Note : Main difference between both concept is using ";" ensure if there is any error between any command it will not stop the execution 
of another command all command will we executed for example if we have error in command 2 there is no affect in command 3 and 4 execution

In second case "&&" if there is error in one command it will stop execution and doesn't execute left over commands 
example there is an error at command 2 then command 3 and 4 will not be executed 


Command Aliasing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alias means a nickname or alternative name 
-> Hence aliasing concept allow us to use nickName for the command 

1) For creating alias name we have to use alias command
	alias nickName="original Command"

Note: don't use space before or after equal symbol some flavour throws error

2) List all alias commands 
	alias

3) Remove alias 
	unalias [Alias Name]

4) Remove all alias names
	unalias -a 


We can use aliasing if we have some complex command which we have to use in regular operations we can just simply give some short name
to the command and use the command with that name only 

But this alias are Session based means it's only available to the terminal in which we define this alias to make them permanent we have 
	2 ways 

1st way of making alias name permanent 
--------------------------------------
Define alias name in .bashrc file which is present in users home directory 
just go and write 
alias nickName="your command"
and save this file now open your new terminal and now this alias is permanent

2nd way of making alias name permanent
---------------------------------------
Instead of editing .bashrc create your own file with name .bash_aliases name should be same and location for this file is users home directory
now you can define your alias in this file also and the alias will we permanent
