Notes about Piping in Linux
---------------------------------------------------

Introduction : Sometimes we want to use output of one command as input to other command. This concept is called piping
Hence by using Piping we can use multiple commands to work together to full fill our requirement

syntax
------------

command 1 | command 2

here "|" this pipe symbol represent piping concept

Example
-------------

ls -l | wc -l 			-> This command will list all the current working directory content 

By default only standard output of the first command will we pipped to the next command you can also redirect standard error also

ls -l 2>&1 | wc -l 		-> Here we are pipping standard output and standard error

Note : Here we are just defining for ls command that standard error and standard input have same behaviour 

Case - 2 
-> Suppose if we want to save the output of one command and use that output in another command simultaneously here we can't use simple piping
hence we need a another concept which is tee command 

tee command -> It's like a T point which create two output stream one to save and one passed to other command to do operation 

syntax
--------------
1) cat abc | tee SaveOutput | wc -l 

here tee is saving over first command output in SaveOutput and also sending the output to third wc -l command also 


Case - 3 
-> Suppose if we want to pass some output to command - 2 , but command - 2 accept command line argument so we need to convert 
standard output of command - 1 to command line argument in this we need to use xargs command 

syntax 
-----------
command - 1 | xargs command - 2 

here command 1 standard output will we converted to command line argument for command - 2 

Example
--------

-> ls | xargs rm -fr 

By this command the current working directory will become empty because ls will return all current directory content and rm remove all
