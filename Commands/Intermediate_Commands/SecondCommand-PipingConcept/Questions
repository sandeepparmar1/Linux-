------------------------

1) What does the pipe operator (|) do in Linux? Please explain its purpose and provide a simple example\

2) How would you use piping to search for a specific word (e.g., "error") in a file named logfile.txt and then count the 
   number of occurrences of that word?

3) Using a pipeline, how would you list the top 5 processes that are consuming the most CPU on your Linux system? 
   You should use ps, sort, and head commands in your solution.

4) How can you use piping and redirection together to search for the word "fail" in a file named results.log, 
   write the lines containing "fail" to a file named failures.txt, and simultaneously display them on the terminal?

5) Describe a scenario where you would combine multiple pipes in a command and explain the flow of data between commands. 
   Provide an example command and explain each part.

6) What does the xargs command do in Linux, and why is it useful when working with pipes?
