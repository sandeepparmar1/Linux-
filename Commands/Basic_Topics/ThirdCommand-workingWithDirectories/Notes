Notes on mkdir , rmdir and rm command
----------------------------------------


mkdir command is used to make directory/folder

1) mkdir <DirName>		-> create directory with given name <DirName>
2) mkdir dir1 dir2 dirN   	-> create multiple directory
3) mkdir dir1/dir2		-> It will create a directory inside directory but parent directory should be available 
4) mkdir -p dir1/dir2		-> It will create full path even parent directory doesn't exits



Example
----------

Create 10 directory with name test1 , test2 ... test10
-> mkdir test{1..10} 		-> This command will create test1 to test10 directory



rmdir command
-----------------

rmdir command is used to delete empty directories if there is any content present in the directory it can't delete the directory for that we
will use rm command

1) rmdir <dirName>		-> remove empty <dirName>
2) rmdir dir1 dir2 dirn 	-> remove multiple empty directories 

Note -> In real world we use rm command more to delete directories rather then rmdir command Âƒ


rm command
------------------

rm command is used to delete files and directories 


1) rm <fileName>		-> Delete file <fileName> 
2) rm -r <dirName>		-> r stands for recursive it will delete whole directory even if it contain anything
3) rm -f <fileName> 		-> f means forecly if we don't want any error message to display 
4) rm -i <fileName> 		-> i means interactive it will ask before deleting
5) rm -v <fileName>		-> v means verbose it will show sequence of removal
