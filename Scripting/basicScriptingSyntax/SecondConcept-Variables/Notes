Notes on variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Variables are like place holders to hold values, variables are like key value pairs
In linux shell programming there is no data type concept everything is treated as "Text" type only


All variables are divided into Two types
-----------------------------------------
1) Predefined / environment variables
2) User Defined variables

1) Predefined / environment variables
-> These variables are mostly used by sytem internally, but based on our requirement we can use in our script also

We can get all environment variable information by using
--> env command

USER DEFINED VARIABLES
-----------------------------------

Based on our programming requirements, we can define our own variable also

Rules to define variables :
---------------------------
1) It's highly recommended to use only upper case letter and for multiple word we can use "_" 
example - TEST_VARIABLE

2) Variable names shouldn't start with digit

3) We shouldn't use special symbol in between variable names

NOTES : to define readonly variables we can use readonly keyword 

for example: A=100; readonly A

This will make A constant/final
sandeep@sandeep:~$ A=20
sandeep@sandeep:~$ readonly A
sandeep@sandeep:~$ echo ${A}
20
sandeep@sandeep:~$ A=200
-bash: A: readonly variable


-> Variable Scope
-----------------------

1) Session Scope
2) User Scope
3) System Scope


1) Session Scope -> The variable which are declared in the terminal are said to be in session scope once we close terminal automatically
all these variable will be gone 

2) User Scope -> The variable which are defined inside .bashrc or any file which automatically load at the time of creation session 
can be used to define user scope variable and it will we available to specific user every time he load terminal

3) System Scope -> These variables available for all users in our system , In /etc/ directory there is a file name as "profile" we can
define system scope variables there 

And last thing to note is system priority work same as programming language
1) Session Scope ---------> User Scope ----------> System Scope
