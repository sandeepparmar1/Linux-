Introduction to shell scripting
----------------------------------------------

-> So before shell scripting let's understand what is shell ?

Works shell do is:
----------------------------
Shell is responsible to read command provided by user 
Shell will check whether command is valid or not and it's properly used or not
If everything is proper then shell converts the command into kernel understandable form and handover that converted command to kernel

-> Then kernel is responsible to execute that command with the help of hardware 
-> Hence shell act as interface between user and hardwar

Types of shells :
-------------------------

1) Bourne shell - developed by stephen bourne it's first shell 
2) Bash 
3) korn 
4) Cshell
5) Tshell 
etc ...

Default shell is bash shell we can use other shell also if we needed 


-> What is shell script 

A sequence of commands saved to a file and this file is nothing but shell scripts,
It gave us more programmatic features like( control statement , loops etc) 
For complex requirement where only commands are not a efficent approach we can use scripts to do those tasks

NOTE: user should have execute permission to execute scripts

-> To run any script we have to use 

/bin/bash ./ScriptName.sh -> If script present in current working directory

and bash is default so we can use ./ScriptName (./) represent location of script

NEXT CONCEPT IS IMPORTANCE OF SHA-BANG

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---- Sharp
! ---- Bang

hence #! ---> sharp bang or sha-bang 

#! represent sha-bang concept 

-> By using sha-bang, we can specify the interpreter which is responsible to execute the script
-> In other word we can define which shell should be used to execute over script by help of sha-bang

Example 
#! /bin/bash
	or
#! /bin/sh
